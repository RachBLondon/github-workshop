# github-workshop

We currently have a problem with our handler. We have gone through the process of initually serving the user a link to github login.

After our call back url is displayed in the clients browser, but in the handler the `if else` branch of the handler is not excuting.
We have tried adding a favicon but its still not working.

Have compared to the Oauth code ---- good luck!
